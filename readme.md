In this assignment you will work in a group of 4 to 6 to produce a report on various aspects of the IT industry as well as a plan for an IT project.

Groups are self-organised in Canvas, under the People section.

This is a group assignment, a continuation to Assignment 2. Each person in the group will receive the same mark, unless there are extenuating circumstances which your group has discussed with the instructor or the contribution form / SparkPLUS / Feedback expresses a sizeable difference in contributions and efforts made towards the completion of this assessment.

Your work needs to constitute a self-contained document that makes sense without the reader referring to the marking specification to understand the meaning of the information that you are communicating.
